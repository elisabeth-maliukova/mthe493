These are the main files used for java implementation. 
Some additional hacked together code was used to generate data specific to report values -
this is enough of the reusable code so that everything can be recreated

Mainly quantizer training / saving in java and the python file updated to load data from quantizer

May have to reorder project file structure or edit files to run code.
Files were all under src/main/ within the java project
